##Software installation

We start the installation scripts of all the needed software via the terminal.
 

Do not forget to type "./" in front of the name.


These scripts will point to some of the other scripts in the folder. So keep them together.


Some of the applications that will be installed are

	Spotify
	Sublime Text
	Variety
	Inkscape
	Plank
	Screenfetch
	...

There are other scripts for more applications. If needed, you can install them individually.



##Install Arc Theme


Ofcourse you can install new themes. I like the **Arc** theme which I will use in the later screenshots. 

I install the **original blue** Arc theme but also my personally created Arc themes (see Arc Colora folder).



##Install your individual Arc Theme

You can change the blue accent colour from the Arc theme with these scripts to **any colour** you like : 

Read here for more info on Arc Based Themes : http://erikdubois.be/category/themes/arc-based-themes/

##Download the Sardi icons

You can install the sardi icons via the scripts


This icon theme can be downloaded at sourceforge.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sardi/

You can also use

	- packer -S sardi-icons 
	- pacaur -S sardi-icons 
	- yaourt -S sardi-icons 



Sardi is **meant to be changed by the users**. You can use scripts to change the hexadecimal colour code in about 3 seconds.


Start your reading about Sardi here : http://erikdubois.be/overview-sardi-icons-version-9-sardi-extra-icons/

Follow the collection on google+ : https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/YFP-LB

The most recent pictures can be found there.

More documentation on http://erikdubois.be/category/sardi-icons/


##Download the Sardi-extra icons

There is also a collection of **Sardi Extra** icons at 

https://github.com/erikdubois/Sardi-Extra

These icons can be downloaded but will not be maintained. Nor are they part of the core icons of Sardi. They are the result of ideas and scripts that are included in Sardi icons.


More documentation on http://erikdubois.be/category/sardi-icons/


##Download the Surfn icons


For ease of installation I use the script.


You can also use

	- packer -S surfn-icons 
	- pacaur -S surfn-icons 
	- yaourt -S surfn-icons 




More info can be found here : https://github.com/erikdubois/Surfn


##Install the Aureola conky collection


This is an exercise in writing conky configurations in lua syntax.


In above screenshots you can see the conky's at work.

##Change the cursor


I like the breeze cursors.

##Install the plank and download 100+ themes


Plank is installed via the main scripts.

If you want to install 100+ plank themes, you need to run the script.


Find plank in the menu and start it. <b>CTRL + Right-click</b> on the plank and choose preferences
and put in on top.

##Change from bash to zsh in your terminal

I like bash but I prefer zsh with lots of different themes from oh-my-zsh to spice things up. So let us install that via the script.

##Download this github for ease of installation

You can run any of these scripts by downloading the zip file from github. Go to the download folder and right-click to **Extract here**.
Go inside the folder and right-click <b>in a blank space</b> to go to the terminal. Now your terminal is opened in this extracted folder.

or 

use the git clone command

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al 

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
